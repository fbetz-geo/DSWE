## Getting Dynamic Surface Water Extent for Landsat Collection 2 in Google Earth Engine
This is an implementation of the dynamic surface water extraction algorithm for Landsat
collection 2 basing upon the algorithm of Jones (2019). This work is inspired by 
by [Ben DeVries](https://github.com/bendv/eedswe/) who presented GEE code for 
the early version of DSWE and Landsat collection 1. The python code here is a new
implementation of the updated USGS DSWE algorithm and Landsat collection 2 
surface reflection.


### Use the python code
You will need an account and authentication for Google Earth Engine 
to get started. Once you have a working earth engine account, you can install
the python package from github:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fbetz-geo/cloudDSWE
cd cloudDSWE
pip install .
```
